						MuayThai is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking
						along with various clinching techniques.
					</p>
					<p class="template4-paragraph-custom">
						This physical and mental discipline which includes combat on shins
						is known as "the art of eight limbs" because it is characterized by
						the combined use of fists, elbows, knees, shins, being associated
						with a good physical preparation that makes a full-contact fighter
						very efficient.

									made in the kitchen”. In order to achieve the ideal body goal,
									a well-balanced, healthy and nutritious diet is the most
									important factor. That said, the right exercise routine can
									make the job easier. For anyone looking to lose fat, the key
									is to burn those calories and there are very few sports that
									do it as powerfully as Muay Thai. One hour of Muay Thai
									training burns around 690 calories. Just take one look at any
									Muay Thai fighter’s body: there is hardly an ounce of fat.
									Enough said.</em

									makes an effort to train Muay Thai regularly, he/she will get
									better at it and so will their confidence grow.

									that of the teep, or push kick, that can disrupt and stop an
									offending attack. These, and other Muay Thai techniques can
									translate to powerful self-defence skills in real life. Nobody
									wants to be in any threatening situations but being armed with
									martial arts skills like Muay Thai can’t hurt. Men, and
